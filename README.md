Citrine API Challenge Problem

API can be accessed from "/units/si?". Enter the units you would like converted as shown (units=degree/minute). A json response will be returned in the form of { “unit_name”: "", “multiplication_factor”: 0 }. If you enter a unit, not supported you will get the following response { “unit_name”: "N/A", “multiplication_factor”: 0 }.
